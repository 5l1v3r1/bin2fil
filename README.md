# Bin2fil converter

This is a simple routine that converts .bin files into filterbank format, writing also the header.

### Prerequisites

Make sure node.js and npm are installed on your machine and the executables directory is in you PATH environment variable.
This is a cross platform software working with electron so in theory it should work fine on all operative systems.

### Installing
```
npm install
```
### Executing
```
npm start
```
