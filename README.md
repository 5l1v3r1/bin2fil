# Bin2fil converter

This is a simple routine that converts .bin files into filterbank format, writing also the header.

### Prerequisites

Make sure node.js and npm are installed on your machine and the executables directory is in you PATH environment variable.
This is a cross platform software working with electron so in theory it should work fine on all operative systems.

### Installing

if you don't want to compile the code you can simply run opening the terminal in the code folder and run:

```
npm start
```

instead if you want to compile it you have to run:

```
command not defined yet
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
